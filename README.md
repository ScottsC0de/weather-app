# weather-app
A weather app that gives you current/5 day forecast based on user input

## Description

Search any US city to find out their current/five day weather forecast, providing you the temperature, wind speed, and humidity! 

This project was created to demonstrate the use of *Server Side APIs* in the form of a weather app. Server Side APIs are a powerful web development tool that allow apps to communicate with each other and send requested data. For this project, an API from https://openweathermap.org/ was used. By creating an account and requesting an API key, I was able to add the API call to my project, request weather data from this website, and have it displayed on the screen of my webpage. Overall, a Server Side API is an extremely useful tool that allows your computer to request data from another computer, have it respond, and use that data in your app. 

## Usage

Upon clicking the link to the webpage (see "Links" below), the user will be directed to a webpage containing a weather based UI that includes a user form input and empty boxes. First, type a city in the input box and press the "Search" button. This will initiate a call to the https://openweathermap.org/ server who will then send back that city's current weather as well as the weather for the next 5 days. Also, after searching for a city, that city will be added to the "Recent Searches" section, which you can click on to see that data again.
