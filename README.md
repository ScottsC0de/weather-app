Search any US city to find out their current/five day weather forecast, providing you the temperature, wind speed, and humidity!

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate the use of *Server Side APIs* in the form of a weather app. Server Side APIs are a powerful web development tool that allow apps to communicate with each other and send requested data. For this project, an API from https://openweathermap.org/ was used. By creating an account and requesting an API key, I was able to add the API call to my project, request weather data from this website, and have it displayed on the screen of my webpage. Overall, a Server Side API is an extremely useful tool that allows your computer to request data from another computer, have it respond, and use that data in your app. 

During this project, I learned how to set up API keys, *fetch* data from another app using that key, check to see if the app responds (aka a *promise*), and use that data in my own app. This helped further my knowledge on how to use parameters in JavaScript so that my functions can be used more effectiveley. I also learned more about creating HTML elements from JavaScript and appending them as children elements onto the DOM. Lastly, I learned how to use an image as the background of a webpage using CSS. This code and its use of Server-Side APIs can be used in the future when I need to request data from another website.

## Usage

Upon clicking the link to the webpage (see "Links" below), the user will be directed to a webpage containing a weather based UI that includes a user form input. First, type a city (and its state for more accurate results) in the input box and press the "Search" button. This will initiate a call to the https://openweathermap.org/ server who will then send back that city's current weather as well as its weather forecast for the next 5 days. Also, after searching for a city, that city will be added to the "Recent Searches" section, which you can click on to see that data again.
